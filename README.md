## 3. Abstract (max. 1500 characters incl. spaces) 
Predicting the results of elections is an area which has due to its advantages for political parties generated considerable interest in political research as well as computer science. This has been, at least from a methodological perspective, primarily an economic topic and outside of the scope of digital humanities research. This project aims to fill this gap between political sciences and digital humanities by using digital humanities methods to investigate the extent to which these methods can be used to predict election results. The project will use the Austrian presidential elections in 2016 and 2022 as a case study, examining data collected from the social media platform Twitter and comparing them to election data provided by Cambridge Analytics. The main aim of the project is to investigate how well digital humanities methods can be used to accurately predict election results. Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling have been chosen as methods to gain the relevant data from Twitter. Due to the complex nature of social media platforms, especially Twitter (trolls, sarcasm, influence of blue checkmarks) this examination could become tricky, however the answers could provide a different perspective that would also highlight the limitations and scope of digital humanities methods. In the end the project will reflect on the results obtained through these digital humanities methods and their accuracy/use for predicting the Austrian presidential elections.
